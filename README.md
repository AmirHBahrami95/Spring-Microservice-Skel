# Spring-Microservice-Skel
A Skleton for spring microservice applications. Configured for an easy templating solution only using one simple script. 

## How-To
simply go inside the folder and
``` 
chmod +x ./z_change_name.sh 
./z_change_name.sh
```

note that changing the name will also change the __z_change_name.sh__ file itself. so if you wanna keep using this template
keep a copy of that file somewhere and then replace it with the changed one after you run it. (actualy might add this to the
script myself, but not now)
